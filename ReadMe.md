     title="PowerShell">

This is a collection of my many powershell scripts, functions, one liners etc... that i have used at some point throughout my carrer and day to day. These were written for various reasons - some were used in CI/CD pipelines, written to automate some of the more boring tasks, for one off unique cases where manual intervention in the GUI would have taken too long or just to have in my profile to speed up my workflows. Because of this these scripts are, well, _all over the place_. Some of them are quite old, some are new, some (like those using AzureRM) could stand to be updated... Please tread the waters carefully. 

#### I see errors!
Please put in a pull request or ping me and let me know, as i said, the state of these is all over the place. I have tried to correct the obvious issues as i have moved them over but Im bound to miss something at some point.
